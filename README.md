# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was designed as a means of showcasing my projects to employers. It will help me in my job search by providing potential employers with proof of my skills. By creating this, I learned about HTML, CSS, and resizing pages for accessibility with smaller screens.

## Installation

There are no installation instructions. Simply go to the website and click as you would like. Please note - links are not active as of 10/24/2022.

## Usage

Links are clickable, and will lead to the projects as described once live.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

'''md
![alt text](./assets/Images/Portfolio%20Screenshot.png)
